# SweatSync 💪

A personal workout tracking web app that actually focuses on what matters: consistent tracking and meaningful progress insights. No BS, no bloat.

## 🎯 Vision

SweatSync was born from a simple need: I wanted a straightforward way to track workouts without the bloat of commercial fitness apps. Something that:

- Works seamlessly on my phone during workouts
- Tracks progressive overload (the key to actual strength gains)
- Handles both rep-based and time-based exercises
- Lets me upload custom workout plans from JSON (because who doesn't love having an AI design their workout?)
- Shows my consistency streaks and keeps me accountable

This isn't about social features or competing with strangers on the internet. It's about you and getting stronger.

## 🚀 Features

### Currently Working

- ✅ User authentication (secure login for you and your partner)
- ✅ Daily workout tracking with sets, reps, and weights
- ✅ Basic workout history
- ✅ Mobile-responsive design
- ✅ Exercise notes for form cues or personal reminders

### Coming Soon
